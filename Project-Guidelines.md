# Pick up where we left off

This repo contains a Next.js project for the front end of this website. We are styling it using TailWind CSS and DaisyUI for components.

You will find the pages inside the app directory.
The components directory contains small sections of the front end.

We have the docs hosted right [here](https://github.com/NoumanAMalik/i-love-ai-docs). Every time a page is opened, in this [line of code](https://github.com/viviantang20/4990-project/blob/d43bd3b631b7fef83458452d375e44b917e552be/app/lesson/%5Bslug%5D/page.js#L51), it makes a fetch to the docs repo to get the markdown content to display to the user.

To get the GitHub api working, I created a GitHub Access Token.

The website is hosted on Vercel, which is the easiest way to host the site.

To continue working on the project, you can fork both repositories, then go to Vercel and host the front end site. You will also need to create a GitHub Access Token, and add that to the Vercel environemnt variables. Then you would be able to continue developing the site.

Take a look at our [README.md](https://github.com/viviantang20/4990-project?tab=readme-ov-file#i--ai-learning-tool) for more information.
